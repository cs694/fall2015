<h2 class="page-header">Course Policies</h2>

<p>See below for the course policies regarding attendance, late work, and the honor code. The policies for this class are strict, but students concerned about their grades are welcome to inquire about extra credit opportunities.</p>

<h3>Late Policy</h3>

<p>It the responsibility of the student to turn in assignments <strong>before</strong> (not at or after) the deadline provided. Assignments turned in up to 24 hours late will receive an automatic 10% grade deduction. Assignments turned in later than 24 hours will not be graded.</p>

<p>Exceptions to this policy are made only in the case of verifiable medical or family emergency. Extensions must be arranged <strong>prior</strong> to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).</p>

<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>All students are expected to know and adhere to the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code/">Academic Honor Code</a> of the University of San Francisco. The pledge all students must adhere to is:</p>

<blockquote>
I pledge to demonstrate the core values of the University of San Francisco by upholding the standards of <strong>honesty</strong> and <strong>integrity</strong>, <strong>excellence</strong> in my academic work, and <strong>respect for others</strong> in my educational experiences, including supporting USF's mission.
