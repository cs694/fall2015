<h3>Attendance Requirements</h3>

<p>Students are expected to attend all lectures and arrive on-time. Students that exceed more than 2 unexcused absences throughout the semester will fail the course.</p>

<h3>Participation Requirements</h3>

<p>Students are expected to actively participate in class discussions. To help facilitate these discussions, students must read one paper per week and prepare a brief summary describing that paper. These assignments are due before the start of class each week.</p>

<h3>Presentation Requirements</h3>

<p>To receive an A letter grade, graduate students must prepare at least one 30 minute presentation on a paper, tool, or technology related to data visualization, or lead at least one of the scheduled 60 minute paper discussions. Students that wish to complete this requirement must consult with the instructor to have a topic and date approved.</p>

<p>Undergraduate students are also welcome to complete this requirement to make up missed lectures or incomplete assignments.</p>

<h2 class="page-header">Course Policies</h2>

<h3>Late Policy</h3>

<p>It the responsibility of the student to turn in assignments <strong>before</strong> (not at or after) the deadline provided. Assignments turned in up to 24 hours late will receive an automatic 10% grade deduction. Assignments turned in later than 24 hours will not be graded.</p>

<p>Exceptions to this policy are made only in the case of verifiable medical or family emergency. Extensions must be arranged <strong>prior</strong> to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).</p>

<h3>Academic Honesty</h3>

<p>All students are expected to know and adhere to the <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code/">Academic Honor Code</a> of the University of San Francisco. The pledge all students must adhere to is:</p>

<blockquote>
I pledge to demonstrate the core values of the University of San Francisco by upholding the standards of <strong>honesty</strong> and <strong>integrity</strong>, <strong>excellence</strong> in my academic work, and <strong>respect for others</strong> in my educational experiences, including supporting USF's mission.
<footer><cite>USF Academic Honor Pledge at <a href="http://www.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code/">http://www.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code/</a></cite></footer>
</blockquote>

<p>The standards of "honesty and integrity" includes statements on cheating, plagiarism, and fraud. This covers the use of unauthorized materials, participating in unauthorized collaboration, copying without attribution work from the web or elsewhere, and in any way representing the work of others as one's own.
