<h2 class="page-header">Course Policies</h2>

<p>The following are the policies specific to this course. The policies for this class are strict, but students concerned about their grades are welcome to inquire about extra credit opportunities.</p>

<h3>Late Submissions</h3>

<p>It the responsibility of the student to turn in assignments <strong>before</strong> (not at or after) the deadline provided. Late assignments will not be graded.</p>

<p>Exceptions to this policy are made only in the case of verifiable medical or family emergency. Extensions must be arranged <strong>prior</strong> to the original deadline unless in case of extreme emergency (such as an emergency room visit).</p>

<h3>Honor Code Violations</h3>

<p>All students are expected to know and adhere to the <a href="http://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code">Academic Honor Code</a> of the University of San Francisco. See the "University Policies" section in this syllabus for more information.</p>

<p><strong>You must never represent another person's work as your own.</strong> Examples of violations include (but are not limited to): copying and pasting text without attribution from a paper or the web, copying from another student, and having anyone other than yourself complete your assignments. It also includes working too closely with another student. Unauthorized collaboration or discussion that results in the same or very similar submissions indicates that you have not placed enough independent work into your submission and is a violation of the honor code.</p>

<p><strong class="text-danger">Flagrant or repeat violations of the honor code will result in an F in the course, a report to the Academic Integrity Committee (AIC), and a report to the Dean.</strong> At the discretion of the instructor, a less severe penalty may be imposed for minor or first offenses. This is at the sole discretion of the instructor and <em>any</em> violation may result in an F in the course.</p>


<h2 class="page-header">University Policies</h2>

<p>The following policies apply to all students at the University of San Francisco. Visit the <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/policies">General Catalog</a> at <a href="https://www.usfca.edu/catalog/policies">www.usfca.edu/catalog/policies</a> for more information.</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>As a Jesuit institution committed to <em>cura personalis</em>&mdash;the care and education of the whole person&mdash;USF has an obligation to embody and foster the values of honesty and integrity. USF upholds the standards of honesty and integrity from all members of the academic community. All students are expected to know and adhere to the University's <a href="http://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code">Academic Honor Code</a>. Visit <a href="http://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code">myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity</a> for the full text of the honor code.</p>

<p>The policy includes standards of "honesty and integrity" that cover cheating, plagiarism, and academic fraud. This includes the use of unauthorized materials, participating in unauthorized collaboration, copying without attribution work from the web or elsewhere, sharing your work without authorization on the web or elsewhere, and in any way representing the work of others as one's own.</p>

<p>Visit <a href="http://myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity/honor-code">myusf.usfca.edu/academic-integrity</a> for more details. The course-specific penalties for violating the academic honor code are described in the "Course Policies" section of this syllabus.</p>

<p>Open discussion and disagreement is encouraged when done respectfully and in the spirit of academic discourse. There are also a variety of behaviors that, while not against a specific University policy, may create disruption in this course. Students whose behavior is disruptive or who fail to comply with the instructor may be dismissed from the class for the remainder of the class period and may need to meet with the instructor or Dean prior to returning to the next class period.
